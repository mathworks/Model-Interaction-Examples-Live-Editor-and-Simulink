# Examples of how to make models more accessible. Specifically, how to use the MathWorks Live Editor with Simulink models and Simscape models.  This will provide a more interactive way for users to interact with Simulink models without needing to know how to use Simulink. There are examples with and without Simscape so that a Simscape license is not required.
